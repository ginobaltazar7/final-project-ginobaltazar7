# Decentralized Online MEW Marketplace for Endangered Wildlife

Consensys Academy Final Project
Gino Baltazar - baltazar.gino@gmail.com

## Requirements

Truffle v5.0.2

Solidity compiler v0.5.0

Ganache CLI

Node 11.9+

## MEW Marketplace

Project is affectionately inspired by my love of cats and animals, and my passion for conservation of wildlife species.
The concept is around building a storefront between adopters and conservationist/storeowners. Ether purchases on the store funds conservation causes.

- Admins - approving store requests
- MEW Adopters - browse through digitized animals
- MEW Store Owners - add/ sell digitized, initiate stores, make Ether

## MEW Setup, Run and Test

1) Install node on your system. npm install -g truffle and npm install -g ganache-cli

2) Download project to local directory. git clone https://github.com/dev-bootcamp-2019/final-project-ginobaltazar7.git

3) Change your directory to the project directory. cd final-project-ginobaltazar7

4) Acquire the required dependencies like SafeMath.sol. npm install

5) Start Ganache GUI and set the port number to 8545. ganache-cli

6) Run Truffle. truffle compile, truffle migrate, truffle test

7) For the companion very light and basic react app, install the front end dependencies by running npm install, then launch a browser to http://localhost:3000 by running npm run start. Launch Metamask, connect to the truffle blockchain making sure to copy the seed phrase.

## Kind Notes

Some caveats - the code has no additional embellishments such as uport integration due to the lack of time to develop. The author aims to apply some of the learning from this project to develop larger and more applicable contracts and is interested/curious in the gameify aspects. If any of you are interested in staying in touch, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I've enjoyed the Academy, the learnings and new friends/connections. And last note, tools like Truffle have made coding quite more straightforward I would agree - hope to see more such tools from the community in the future.
